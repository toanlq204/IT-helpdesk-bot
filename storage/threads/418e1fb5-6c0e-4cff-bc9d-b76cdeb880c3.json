Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Check Your Credentials**: Make sure you are entering the correct username and password. Check for caps lock or num lock being on.\n\n2. **Restart Your Computer**: Sometimes, a simple restart can resolve login issues.\n\n3. **Use Safe Mode**: Try booting into Safe Mode. You can usually do this by pressing F8 or Shift + F8 during startup. In Safe Mode, you can troubleshoot further.\n\n4. **Reset Your Password**: If you\u2019ve forgotten your password, you can reset it using a password reset disk or through your Microsoft account if it's linked.\n\n5. **Check for Network Issues**: If you're using a Microsoft account, ensure your internet connection is stable.\n\n6. **System Restore**: If you recently installed software or updates, you might want to perform a system restore to revert back to a previous state.\n\nIf these steps do not help, I can create a support ticket for you. Would you like me to do that?",
