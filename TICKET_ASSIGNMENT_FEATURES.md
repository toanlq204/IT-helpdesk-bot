# Ticket Assignment Features

## ✅ **Complete Ticket Assignment System**

I've implemented comprehensive ticket assignment functionality that allows admins to assign tickets to technicians and technicians to self-assign unassigned tickets.

## 🚀 **Key Features Implemented**

### **1. Role-Based Assignment Permissions**

#### **Administrators:**
- ✅ **Assign any ticket** to any technician or admin
- ✅ **Reassign tickets** from one person to another
- ✅ **Unassign tickets** to make them available again
- ✅ **Full assignment control** across all tickets

#### **Technicians:**
- ✅ **Self-assign unassigned tickets** only
- ✅ **Cannot assign to others** (security restriction)
- ✅ **Cannot reassign** already assigned tickets
- ✅ **Quick "Assign to Me" button** for efficiency

#### **Users:**
- ❌ **No assignment capabilities** (view only)

### **2. Enhanced Backend API**

#### **New Endpoints:**
```python
GET /tickets/technicians           # Get list of assignable users
POST /tickets/{id}/assign/{user_id} # Assign ticket to user  
POST /tickets/{id}/unassign        # Unassign ticket (admin only)
```

#### **New Service Functions:**
```python
assign_ticket(db, ticket_id, assigned_to_id, current_user)
unassign_ticket(db, ticket_id, current_user)
```

#### **Permission Logic:**
```python
# Admin: Can assign any ticket to any technician/admin
if current_user.role == "admin":
    assignee = get_technician_by_id(assigned_to_id)
    ticket.assigned_to = assigned_to_id

# Technician: Can only self-assign unassigned tickets
elif current_user.role == "technician":
    if ticket.assigned_to is None and assigned_to_id == current_user.id:
        ticket.assigned_to = current_user.id
```

### **3. Rich Frontend Assignment UI**

#### **Assignment Controls in Header:**
- **Admin View**:
  - 🎯 **"Assign"** button (for unassigned tickets)
  - 🔄 **"Reassign"** button (for assigned tickets)
  - ❌ **"Unassign"** button (remove assignment)
  - 📋 **Technician dropdown** with names and roles

- **Technician View**:
  - 👤 **"Assign to Me"** button (for unassigned tickets only)
  - ✅ **Disabled state** for already assigned tickets

#### **Quick Actions Sidebar:**
- **Context-sensitive buttons** based on ticket state
- **Separate assign/reassign/unassign** actions
- **Loading states** during assignment operations

### **4. Smart Permission Handling**

#### **Conditional Button Display:**
```typescript
const canAssignToOthers = user?.role === 'admin'
const canSelfAssign = user?.role === 'technician' && !ticket.assigned_to

{canAssignToOthers && (
  <Button onClick={() => setIsAssigningUser(true)}>
    {ticket.assigned_to ? 'Reassign' : 'Assign'}
  </Button>
)}

{canSelfAssign && (
  <Button onClick={handleSelfAssign}>
    Assign to Me
  </Button>
)}
```

#### **Dynamic Button Text:**
- **"Assign"** → for unassigned tickets
- **"Reassign"** → for already assigned tickets
- **"Assign to Me"** → for technician self-assignment

## 🎯 **User Experience Features**

### **1. Technician Selection (Admin Only)**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Select technician ▼                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ tech1@company.com (Technician)      │
│ tech2@company.com (Technician)      │
│ admin@company.com (Admin)           │
│ senior@company.com (Technician)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
[Assign] [Cancel]
```

### **2. Assignment Status Display**
```
📋 Ticket Information

🏷️ Ticket ID: #123
👤 Created by: user@company.com (User)
🔧 Assigned to: tech@company.com (Technician)  ← Clear assignment info
📅 Created: 2024-01-15 14:30
🕒 Last updated: 2024-01-15 16:45
```

### **3. Assignment Workflow**

#### **Admin Workflow:**
1. **View any ticket** → See assignment status
2. **Click "Assign"** → Dropdown appears with technicians
3. **Select technician** → Click "Assign" button
4. **Instant update** → Ticket shows new assignee
5. **Can reassign/unassign** at any time

#### **Technician Workflow:**
1. **View unassigned ticket** → See "Assign to Me" button
2. **Click "Assign to Me"** → Instantly self-assigns
3. **Ticket updates** → Shows as assigned to current user
4. **Cannot modify** other assignments

### **4. Visual Feedback**

#### **Loading States:**
- ⏳ **Button disabled** during assignment operations
- 🔄 **Loading spinner** for async operations
- ✅ **Instant UI update** after successful assignment

#### **Assignment Indicators:**
- 🟢 **Assigned tickets**: Show assignee name and role
- 🟡 **Unassigned tickets**: Show "Unassigned" in orange
- 🔵 **Self-assigned**: Show "Assigned to you" for current user

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Backend Architecture**
```python
# Service Layer
def assign_ticket(db, ticket_id, assigned_to_id, current_user):
    # 1. Get ticket with permission check
    # 2. Validate user can assign tickets
    # 3. Validate assignee is technician/admin
    # 4. Update assignment
    # 5. Return updated ticket with user info

# API Layer  
@router.post("/{ticket_id}/assign/{user_id}")
async def assign_ticket_endpoint(ticket_id, user_id, current_user):
    # Call service with permission enforcement
    # Return full ticket with user relationships
```

### **Frontend State Management**
```typescript
// React Query for data fetching
const { assignTicket, unassignTicket, isAssigning } = useTickets()
const { technicians } = useTechnicians()

// Local state for UI
const [isAssigningUser, setIsAssigningUser] = useState(false)
const [selectedAssignee, setSelectedAssignee] = useState('')

// Assignment handlers
const handleAssignTicket = async () => {
  await assignTicket({ ticketId, userId: parseInt(selectedAssignee) })
  await refetch() // Refresh ticket data
}
```

### **Database Optimization**
- **Eager loading** of user relationships in all ticket queries
- **Single query** retrieval of ticket + creator + assignee + note authors
- **Efficient joins** using SQLAlchemy `joinedload()`

## 📊 **Assignment Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Admin Assigns New Ticket**
```
1. New ticket created by user
2. Admin views ticket (status: Unassigned)
3. Admin clicks "Assign" → selects technician
4. Ticket assigned → status shows assignee
5. Technician can now see ticket in "My Tickets"
```

### **Scenario 2: Technician Self-Assigns**
```
1. Technician views unassigned tickets
2. Finds relevant ticket → clicks "Assign to Me"
3. Ticket immediately assigned to technician
4. Appears in technician's assigned tickets list
5. Other technicians no longer see it as available
```

### **Scenario 3: Admin Reassigns Ticket**
```
1. Ticket currently assigned to Tech A
2. Admin needs to reassign to Tech B
3. Admin clicks "Reassign" → selects Tech B
4. Ticket moves from Tech A to Tech B
5. Both technicians see updated assignment
```

### **Scenario 4: Admin Unassigns Ticket**
```
1. Ticket assigned to technician
2. Admin clicks "Unassign" 
3. Ticket becomes unassigned
4. Available for any technician to claim
5. Shows in unassigned tickets list
```
